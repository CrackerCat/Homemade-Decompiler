# Homemade-Decompiler

As part of our final college project, we decided to create our own De-compiler!

The purpose of this Decompiler is, to translate assembly code into a C-like code, to make it far more readable and easy!

We started the project not so long ago (Last update of README: Feb 24th, 2018), so the work will take quite some time, but the outcome will be awesome ! :D
